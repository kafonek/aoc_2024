# Gridthings

This crate was inspired by several puzzle problems from Project Euler and Advent of Code that asked to structure input data as a two-dimensional grid and do things such as finding neighbors, sub-grids, segments, etc. Working with Vecs of Vecs (or lists of lists in Python), or using a framework like Pandas/Polars, tended to be an unergonomic experience.


## Features

 - [x] Get neighbors and segments in cardinal and diagonal directions
 - [ ] Pretty print a grid with Cell formatting (bold, colored, etc)
 - [ ] Pathfinding
